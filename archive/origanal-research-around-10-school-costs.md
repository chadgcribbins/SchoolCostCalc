# 10-Year Private School Cost Projection (Portugal: 2025–2035)

## Overview and Assumptions

This spreadsheet will detail all costs for three children (currently ages 13, 10, and 8) attending the same private school in Portugal over the next 10 years, until the youngest finishes secondary school around 18 years old. We cover three schools – The Lisboan International School, TASIS Portugal, and Saint Dominic's International School – using each school's published tuition and fees. All costs are in EUR (with a summary conversion to GBP at the end). We clearly distinguish one-time mandatory fees (e.g. application, registration/capital fees), recurring mandatory costs (tuition, required annual fees), and optional costs (lunch, transport, etc.), and apply sibling discounts where applicable.

**Assumptions:** For projection simplicity, we use 2025/26 fee rates and assume they remain constant (no inflation). Each child's grade level advances yearly (e.g. the oldest starts around Grade 8 and finishes Grade 12 in year 5; middle from Grade 5 to 12 in year 8; youngest from Grade 3 to 12 by year 10). We'll note any inclusions (e.g. if lunch is included in tuition) and estimate typical optional costs (transportation, meals, uniforms, etc.) per year. The current exchange rate is roughly €1 = £0.835 (April 2025) – this will be used for conversion on the summary page. All figures and formulas in the spreadsheet are editable so you can adjust fees or exchange rates as needed.

## The Lisboan International School

### School Profile

A new British-curriculum international school in Lisbon (opened 2023), offering Nursery through Year 13 (ages 3–18). It follows the UK Key Stages and IB Diploma in the final years.

### One-Time Fees

- **Application Fee**: €250 per child (non-refundable)
- **Registration Fee**: €4,750 per child (one-time, upon enrollment). This acts as a capital/admission fee to secure the student's place. (No separate "capital levy" beyond this.)

For our family: In the first year of enrollment, all three children would incur these one-off fees. That's €250 ×3 = €750 in application fees, and €4,750 ×3 = €14,250 in registration fees (paid once when each child enters the school).

### Annual Tuition Fees

The Lisboan's tuition is structured by year group. They offer an annual payment or termly payments (3 terms per year) with no price difference (annual = 3× term fee). Current annual tuition (2025/26) for representative year groups:

- **Early Years** (Nursery/Reception, ages ~3–4): €11,950 per year (or €3,983 per term)
- **Primary** (e.g. Year 3, age ~8): €15,950 per year
- **Middle School** (e.g. Year 8, age ~13): €17,950 per year
- **High School** (Year 12–13, ages 16–18): €21,950 per year

These rates illustrate the range – from €11.95k in early years up to €21.95k in final year of IB. For our children's current ages, we'd start with roughly Year 9 (~€19,950), Year 6 (~€17,950), and Year 4 (~€16,950) annual tuition in the first projection year (matching their ages 13, 10, 8), then increase as they advance to higher grades. The spreadsheet will list each child's tuition per year for the next 10 years, which the user can adjust if fees change.

### Recurring Annual Fees

Unlike some schools, The Lisboan does not charge an annual re-enrollment or capital fee each year – the €4,750 registration is one-time. So the only required recurring cost is tuition itself (plus any standard inflation, which we are not factoring in here). There is no published sibling discount policy for tuition (we'll assume none). Each year, the family's mandatory cost for The Lisboan will be the sum of three tuitions (with no sibling reduction). The spreadsheet will calculate the family's annual total automatically.

### Optional & Miscellaneous Costs

The Lisboan's materials do not explicitly state if lunch or books are included. We will assume the following optional costs for a normal year, which can be toggled in the sheet:

- **Lunch Program**: Likely not included in tuition (parents can pack lunch or subscribe to cafeteria). Estimate about €1,000 per child per year if opting into a school lunch plan (roughly ~€5-6 per day × 180 school days). (This is adjustable; if The Lisboan ends up including lunch or costing different, update this cell.)
- **Uniforms**: The Lisboan, being a British curriculum school, requires uniforms. Uniform costs are variable, but we can budget ~€300 per child per year on average. Initial year may be higher (e.g. €500 for a full set of uniforms and sports kit) and subsequent years ~€200 for replacements/growth. We will list uniform as a yearly expense per child, marked optional (though in practice mandatory to have uniform, it's not a fee paid to school).
- **Transport**: The school's website doesn't list transport services, but likely a private bus or parent's driving. For comparison, we assume the family might use a school bus service if available. Based on similar Lisbon schools, budget ~€3,000 per child per year for a round-trip school bus (The spreadsheet can be adjusted if you only need one bus pass for all, or if you'll drive yourselves). Alternatively, fuel/parking costs for driving could be considered here.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: The Lisboan will offer diverse clubs and activities. Many may be included, but some specialized activities (e.g. expensive sports or music lessons) could carry fees. We'll include a small miscellaneous extracurricular budget of ~€500 per child/year as optional, assuming things like club fees, sports gear, etc. (If the activities are free or you skip them, you can set this to 0 in the sheet.)
- **School Trips**: Local field trips might be included or low-cost; however, one international trip or overnight camp per year could cost ~€300–€500. We'll include €500/year per child for trips/experiences.
- **Technology/Devices**: From secondary school, students may need a laptop or tablet. We assume you will purchase devices as needed outside of tuition. For example, the oldest might need a new laptop in year 1 (cost ~€1,000) and the younger ones as they reach middle school. We will not itemize this in the yearly fees, but you might want to set aside a tech budget. (You can add a line in the sheet for a laptop in the year a child turns e.g. 11 or 12.)
- **Insurance**: Basic school insurance is often included or a minor fee. We'll assume any required student insurance is minimal (say €50/year) and include that in miscellaneous if needed.

All these optional costs will be listed in the spreadsheet under "Optional Expenses" for each year. You can toggle them by setting the amount to 0 or some value for each child. The spreadsheet will clearly separate the Mandatory Total vs. Optional Total for each year for The Lisboan.

### Payment Plan Options

The Lisboan allows paying tuition term-wise or annually without any surcharge (3 × term fee = annual fee). They do not advertise a monthly plan. In the sheet, we will show the monthly equivalent cost for budgeting (simply annual/10 months for reference). For example, a €15,950/year tuition is about €1,595 per month if spread over 10 months. We'll include columns for "Monthly (approx.)" for tuition and other recurring costs for your reference. There are no discounts for paying annually upfront, and no interest charged for paying per term – it's purely a matter of timing. (If needed, you could manually break the term payments into monthly in the sheet to simulate a payment schedule.)

### Sibling Discount

The Lisboan currently offers no sibling tuition discount (none is mentioned in their admissions info). Therefore, our family will pay full tuition for each of the three children each year. (In contrast, the other schools do have discounts, as we'll see.)

## TASIS Portugal (The American School in Portugal)

### School Profile

An American-style international school (Sintra/Lisbon area) offering Pre-K through High School. It follows an American curriculum with IB Diploma options, known for including many extras in tuition. Our analysis covers Grades 1–12 since our kids are school-aged (TASIS opened high school recently up to Grade 12 by 2025).

### One-Time Fees

- **Application Fee**: €100 per child (for Grade 1–11 applicants; €150 only for Early Learning Center applications). This is non-refundable and paid upon application submission. With three children, that's €300 total in application fees.
- **Enrollment Fee ("Campus Enhancement Fee")**: €5,000 per child (one-time, non-refundable) for students entering Kindergarten or above. This is paid upon accepting an admission offer to secure the spot and contributes to the campus development. All three of our children would each incur this €5,000 fee when they enroll at TASIS (since they are above Pre-K age). Total for family: €15,000 one-time. (Note: For completeness, TASIS uses a €3,000 enrollment deposit for Pre-K, but that doesn't apply to our case).
- **Annual Re-enrollment Fee**: €750 per student, each year. This is a mandatory yearly fee to reserve the child's place for the next academic year (common in TASIS). Our spreadsheet will include €750 per child every year (so €2,250 for three kids per year) as a required cost in addition to tuition.

### Annual Tuition Fees

TASIS tuition is organized by grade level and includes a lot of extras in the price (see below). The school offers both annual payment and trimester payments – the cost is the same either way (annual tuition is simply split into three equal installments). Published tuition for the 2025–2026 year is as follows:

- **Grades 1–2**: €16,470 per year (which can be paid as three installments of €5,490)
- **Grades 3–5**: €18,330 per year (3 × €6,110)
- **Grades 6–8**: €19,080 per year (3 × €6,360)
- **Grades 9–10**: €21,990 per year (3 × €7,330)
- **Grades 11–12**: €23,160 per year (3 × €7,720)

TASIS's fees range roughly from €12k/year in early grades up to ~€23k in the upper grades. In our scenario, the first year might have the oldest in Grade 8 (~€19,080), middle in Grade 5 (~€18,330), youngest in Grade 3 (~€18,330) – note the middle and youngest could both be in the same 3–5 bracket initially, which is convenient. The spreadsheet will list each child's tuition per year as they move through these brackets. (We can adjust if exact grade placements differ; these are ballpark given ages.)

### What Tuition Includes

One notable aspect of TASIS is that many typical extras are already included in the tuition fee. According to TASIS, annual tuition includes: all textbooks and instructional materials, a healthy lunch and two snacks daily, standard field trips, and even after-school clubs/sports and certain program resources. For example, each child's lunch (valued at ~€1,100/year) is part of tuition, so you do not pay extra for school meals. Basic after-school activities and even items like string instruments for elementary music classes are included. This means no separate lunch fee or basic activity fee needs to be budgeted – a key difference from the other schools. (Our sheet will mark lunch as "Included" for TASIS, with €0 extra cost by default.)

However, some costs still fall outside tuition:

- **Uniforms**: TASIS requires uniforms (purchased through their shop). Uniform cost is not included in tuition. We will budget similarly ~€300 per child per year for uniform/clothing.
- **Transportation**: Not included. TASIS does not have a free bus service, but they will assist families in arranging private transport routes. The cost can vary by distance; we'll assume ~€3,000 per year per child for a bus service (similar to St. Dominic's bus rates) if used. Adjust or set to 0 if you plan to drive instead.
- **Personal devices**: As students advance, they may need laptops (not provided by school). Similar to Lisboan, budget separately if needed.
- **Exam Fees**: External exams (e.g. IB Diploma exams or SAT/AP tests) are not included. For IB in Grade 12, one might expect a few hundred euros in exam registration fees. We will include an estimate (around €750 in the final year for the IB exam fees per student) as an optional item for the oldest two when they reach that stage (the youngest will hit IB exams in the last projected year).

### Sibling Discount

TASIS offers a sibling discount only for the 3rd and 4th child enrolled concurrently (no discount for the second child). Specifically, the third child gets 15% off tuition, and a fourth would get 25% off. In our family of three, this means the youngest (third child) would receive a 15% tuition discount as long as all three are enrolled together. Once the oldest graduates (leaving two children in school), no sibling discounts would apply (since only two remain and TASIS gives nothing for two). The spreadsheet will automatically apply a 15% reduction to the youngest child's tuition for each year until any one child leaves. We'll model this by a conditional: for years 1–5, all three are in school so 15% off the youngest's fee; for years 6–10 (after the eldest finishes in year 5), only two remain so no discount. (If you anticipate a different timeline, you can adjust the years this discount applies or if a 4th child were added, etc.)

### Payment Plan Options

TASIS allows annual payment or tri-annual (trimester) payments. There is no financial penalty or discount for choosing one or the other – paying in three installments simply splits the cost. They do not advertise a monthly payment plan, but for budgeting, we include a monthly breakdown column (e.g. a €18,330 tuition is ~€1,833 per month over 10 months). The sheet will note that the first installment is due July 1, second December 1, third March 1 (per their schedule) – but for simplicity of cash flow, you might just look at the monthly equivalent. No surcharges are added for the installment plan (0% interest).

### Recurring Annual Fees

Besides tuition, remember to include the €750 re-enrollment fee for each child every year as a mandatory cost. Our spreadsheet will list this as "Re-enrollment fee" each year for each child. (No sibling discount on this flat fee; it's per student.)

### Optional/Miscellaneous Costs

Thanks to TASIS's all-inclusive tuition, optional add-ons are fewer: lunch and basic activities are covered. Optional costs to budget:

- **Uniforms**: ~€300/year per child (as above).
- **Transport (Bus)**: ~€3,000/year per child if used (adjustable).
- **Additional Activities**: If a child takes on an extra-cost activity (for example, private music lessons or an expensive sport not covered), you might allocate some budget. We'll include a small placeholder (e.g. €500/year) for any such extras, though many clubs are free.
- **School Trips**: Most local trips are included, but optional international trips (e.g. high school service trips or Week Without Walls programs) could cost extra. We can put €500/year per child as a buffer for any significant trip not included.
- **Exam Prep/College**: By later years, you might have costs for SAT prep, college applications, etc., but those are outside school fees scope (and vary widely).

All these will be listed under optional in the TASIS sheet, with defaults that you can modify. The mandatory vs optional totals will be clearly separated so you can see baseline costs versus full participation costs.

## Saint Dominic's International School

### School Profile

An established IB World School in Lisbon (São Domingos de Rana), offering the IB PYP, MYP, and Diploma programs for ages 3–18. It is a non-profit school with a long history. It has a structure of Nursery (Kindergarten 1–3) and Grades 1–12 (roughly aligning with ages 6–18).

### One-Time Fees

- **Application Fee**: €1,000 per child (non-refundable). This is paid when applying. For three children, that's €3,000 total up front.
- **Capital Levy (Enrollment Fee)**: €5,000 per child (one-time). This is an entry fee to support school facilities, due upon admission acceptance. Each of our three children would require this, totaling €15,000 one-time. (Note: St. Dominic's is non-profit, so this capital fee likely goes toward development; it's comparable to TASIS's fee.)
- **Annual Registration Fee**: €1,120 – €2,050 per year, per child. This is a yearly administrative fee required to register for the new school year. The exact amount varies by grade level (lower grades pay the lower end, older grades the higher). We will approximate it based on division: for example, in primary years we'll use ~€1,200, middle years ~€1,500, and IB diploma years ~€2,050. This fee is mandatory each year on top of tuition. Our spreadsheet will list it for each student annually, adjustable by grade. (For a rough estimate, we can set: Grades 1–5: €1,200; Grades 6–10: €1,500; Grades 11–12: €2,050. These can be refined if exact values are provided by the school.)

### Annual Tuition Fees

St. Dominic's tuition is structured by grade (and generally a bit lower in primary, rising significantly in high school). Current annual tuition (2025–2026) roughly:

- **Grades 1–5**: around €14,200–€15,000 per year (e.g. Grade 1: €14,200; Grade 5: €15,000)
- **Grades 6–8** (Middle Years): roughly €17,100–€17,400 per year (Grade 6: €17,100; Grade 8: €17,400)
- **Grade 9–10**: about €20,500 per year (significant jump in high school).
- **Grades 11–12** (IB Diploma Programme): €22,000 per year

In other words, tuition ranges from ~€11.5k in Kindergarten to €22k in the final year, with middle school around €17k. In our scenario's first year, the children might be in Grade 9 (~€20,500), Grade 6 (~€17,100), and Grade 4 (~€14,900). The spreadsheet will list each child's tuition each year as they advance, and you can adjust the exact grade or fee if needed.

### Recurring Fees and Inclusions

St. Dominic's tuition typically does NOT include lunch or transport. It covers the basic academic program. Some points to note:

- There is an annual PTA fee of €35 per family, usually charged with the first term's bill. We will include this €35 once per year (not per child, just once for the family).
- Basic classroom materials are generally provided, but textbooks or certain workbooks might be charged or bought by parents (not explicitly stated; we will assume they are included or negligible, since not listed in fees).
- The school has a cafeteria program (Refectory) – lunches are paid per term or annually as per usage. We'll budget ~€1,000 per child/year for lunches if they eat at school. This would be optional (if you pack lunches, it becomes zero).
- **Exam Fees**: IB exam fees in Grade 12 are extra (approx. €700-€800 per student for all exams). We'll budget €800 in the final year for each child's IB exam registration (the oldest two will incur this in their last year).
- **Insurance**: There may be a small student insurance fee annually (not listed publicly; often ~€50). We can include a token €50/year per child under miscellaneous mandatory costs, or just note it. (This is minor relative to other costs.)

### Sibling Discount

St. Dominic's offers sibling discounts for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th children, which will significantly help our family. According to the school: the second child gets 5% off tuition, the third child gets 15% off tuition, and a fourth would get 25% off. This discount applies to tuition fees only (not to the annual registration or other fees typically). For our three children concurrently enrolled, that means: one child at full tuition, second child 5% off, third child 15% off (the school usually applies the largest discount to the youngest or the lowest tuition fee, but regardless, the net effect is as stated). We will assume the oldest pays full, second gets 5%, youngest gets 15% off tuition each year while all three are in school. Once the oldest graduates (in our projection, after year 5), we then have two children left – at that point the "second child" discount of 5% would apply to the younger of the two. Finally, when down to one child (last few years when only the youngest remains), no discount applies. The spreadsheet will implement this by applying 5% and 15% reductions appropriately per year. (All these percentage cells are editable if the policy changes or if, say, the discount should be applied differently.)

### Payment Plan Options

St. Dominic's uses a term payment schedule (3 terms). Tuition for each term is due before the term begins (Jul 1, Dec 1, Mar 1 as typical). They invoice certain fees with specific terms (e.g. the annual registration fee is billed with the 3rd term's invoice each year). There is no discount for paying the whole year upfront, and generally no official monthly plan. (Some families might arrange monthly payments informally, but the standard is term-wise.) We will present the annual totals, but also a monthly equivalent for budgeting (divide annual total by 10). If you prefer to consider a 12-month average, you can adjust that calculation. No interest or surcharge is mentioned for the term system – it's the default. We did not find a semi-annual option, so we assume everyone follows the 3-term schedule. The sheet can note the due dates and split if needed (or you can treat each term as ~1/3 of tuition + relevant fees).

### Optional & Miscellaneous Costs

We should plan for additional costs similar to the other schools:

- **Lunch**: (~€1,000/year per child) as mentioned, since not included. We will list this as optional per child per year. (If the child occasionally buys cafeteria lunch, you could adjust the amount. For full year school lunches, ~€6/day is a fair estimate which is ~€1k/year.)
- **Transport (Bus Service)**: The school offers a bus service with annual cost ~€2,850 (and up to €3,500 for a late bus option). We'll use €3,000/year per child in our model for the bus, similar to others. If you only need one bus fare (e.g. siblings ride together for one fee) – unlikely, usually it's per student seat – you could adjust it. Otherwise, if driving yourselves, set this to 0 and consider fuel costs separately.
- **Uniforms**: Yes, required. Budget ~€300/child/year as before.
- **After-School Activities**: St. Dominic's has after-school programs (sports, arts, etc.). Some are included, some may have extra fees (e.g. external clubs or competitions). We include ~€500/child/year for any paid activities or sports equipment, as an optional category.
- **School Trips**: IB schools often have week-long trips or CAS (Creativity-Action-Service) projects, especially in the IB Diploma years, that can cost extra. Also, Middle School trips or ski trips might be offered. We'll allocate €500/year per child for trips/camps. In reality, some years might have higher cost trips (e.g. an overseas trip costing €1,000+) and other years minimal – you can adjust year by year in the sheet.
- **Miscellaneous**: Any other school-related spending (e.g. school events, yearbook, graduation fees, etc.) can be given a small buffer – we might fold this into a general misc. line of a couple hundred euros.

Important: We will ensure the spreadsheet separates mandatory costs (tuition, annual registration fee, PTA fee, etc.) from optional costs (lunch, bus, etc.) for St. Dominic's. For instance, the annual registration fee will be listed in the "mandatory" section each year (and it's a sizeable amount, making St. Dominic's upfront yearly fees higher even if tuition is moderate). Optional costs like lunch and bus can be toggled if the family chooses not to use those services.

## Spreadsheet Structure and Sheets Layout

The Google Sheets workbook will contain four main sheets: one for each school (Lisboan, TASIS, St. Dominic's) detailing yearly costs, and a Summary Comparison sheet. All financial figures (tuition rates, fees, etc.) are input into separate cells so that the user can easily update them (for example, if fees increase or if a discount percentage changes).

### 1. Individual School Sheets (Lisboan, TASIS, St. Dominic's)

Each of these sheets will have a detailed breakdown structured as follows:

- **Header Section**: Lists key one-off fees and assumptions for that school. For example, at the top of "The Lisboan" sheet, we'll list the application fee (€250) and registration fee (€4,750) and show the total for 3 kids (these can be broken out in cells for each child and summed). Similarly, for TASIS and St. Dominic's, top section will show the one-time enrollment fees (and in St. Dominic's case, the capital levy total, etc.). This provides an overview of upfront costs in year 1. These can be presented in a small table: e.g. "One-Time Fees" with rows for Application, Registration/Capital Fee, etc., and columns for Child 1, Child 2, Child 3, Total. (All these cells are editable if, say, a fee is waived or changes.)

- **Year-by-Year Table**: Below the header, a table listing each academic year from 2025/26 through 2034/35 as rows. For each year, we will have columns detailing costs for each child and totals. To keep it clear, we can group columns by child. For example:
  - Child 1: Tuition, +Annual Fees, =Subtotal; Child 2: Tuition + Fees =Subtotal; Child 3: Tuition + Fees =Subtotal; Family Mandatory Total (sum of subtotals for that year). Then separate columns for Optional Total for that year and finally Grand Total for that year. We might also include a column for Monthly Equivalent of the grand total (just dividing the grand total by 10 or 12 for reference).

Each child's "Tuition" cell for a given year will reference that child's grade level fee for that year. We will pre-fill these based on the current fee schedule and the child's progression. For instance, on the St. Dominic's sheet, for 2025/26 we'll put Child1 tuition = €20,500 (Grade 9), Child2 = €15,000 (Grade 5), Child3 = €14,600 (Grade 3), then 2026/27 increase each according to next grade's fee, etc. These values can be formula-driven (if we set up a lookup table of fees by grade) or manually entered and can be adjusted easily if needed (e.g. if fees rise 3%, user can change them). We will also include the sibling discount calculations here: e.g. on St. Dominic's sheet, Child2's tuition cell might have a formula = (base fee) _ 95% (5% off), Child3 = base _ 85% (15% off) for years when all 3 present, and adjust in later years. We'll clearly highlight these discounted tuition cells (perhaps note "(5% off applied)" in a comment). On the TASIS sheet, Child3's tuition cell will be = base fee \* 85% for the appropriate years. The Lisboan sheet will just have full tuition = base (no discount).

Annual Fees column for each child will include things like re-enrollment fees or annual registration fees. For example, on the TASIS sheet, each child's Annual Fee column will show €750 every year. On St. Dominic's, it will show €1,200/€1,500/€2,050 depending on grade (we can link it to grade or just fill it manually for each year). On Lisboan, this column is essentially 0 (no yearly fee) so we might omit it or leave it blank for Lisboan to simplify.

Each child's Subtotal (Mandatory) = Tuition (after any discount) + annual required fees (re-enrollment or reg fee). Then Family Mandatory Total = sum of all three subtotals + any per-family fee (for St. Dominic's, add €35 PTA in one of the children's column or separately). This total represents the minimum the family must pay that year to keep all kids in school.

We will then have a separate section or columns for Optional costs. One approach is to have additional columns for each child's optional expenses (lunch, bus, etc.), but that could double the columns. Instead, we might sum each child's optional items into one "Optional subtotal" per child, and sum those into a Family Optional Total for the year. To keep it simple, we might combine all optional costs for the family in one column per year (assuming if one child takes lunch and another doesn't, the user can individually adjust that child's optional cell). For clarity, we could list optional costs in additional rows instead: e.g. have rows for "Lunch (family total)", "Transport (family total)" per year. However, since optional costs are mostly per child, it might be easier to mirror the structure: each child: lunch + transport + uniform + etc = optional subtotal, then family optional total. To avoid clutter, we might hide these detailed columns by default or group them.

Monthly breakdown: Finally, for each year row, we'll calculate a "Monthly payment (avg)" for the family. Likely we'll use 10 months: Monthly = (Family Mandatory Total + Family Optional Total) / 10. (Or we could do separate monthly for mandatory only.) We'll clarify this in the sheet. This helps to see, for example, "In 2025/26, we'll effectively spend ~€X per month for all kids at School Y."

- **Cumulative Summary**: At the bottom of each school's sheet, we will sum up the totals over the 10-year period. We will provide: Total 10-year Mandatory Costs and Total 10-year Optional Costs (for instance, "Total (2025–2035) without optional extras: €XYZ; with all projected optional: €ABC"). We might also break down the total per child over the 10 years for curiosity (e.g. how much was spent on each child's education at that school – though the question mainly asks for family total). The main focus will be the family total cost for that scenario.

Each school sheet thus provides a comprehensive breakdown, year by year, which the user can edit (e.g. if a child leaves earlier or if one of the optional costs is not needed in a certain year, they can just change that cell). Mandatory vs Optional are clearly labeled, possibly with different colors or separate section headings in the sheet to avoid confusion.

### 2. Summary Comparison Sheet

This sheet will allow an easy side-by-side comparison of the three schools' costs and the conversion to GBP. We will include:

- **A section listing the one-time upfront costs in Year 1 for each school**. For example, a small table:

| School         | Year1 One-time Fees (EUR) | Year1 One-time Fees (GBP) |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| The Lisboan    | €15,000 (approx)          | £12,525                   |
