## Environment Setup

The application requires the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIGMA_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIGMA_FILE_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIGMA_NODE_ID
```

## Deployment Notes

- Deployed on Vercel using custom configuration
- Installation uses `--legacy-peer-deps --force` flags to handle dependency conflicts
- Husky Git hooks are conditionally skipped in production environment

## Next Steps

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for planned future enhancements.

## Resuming Development

When resuming development:

1. Review the latest versions of dependencies
2. Check for security updates
3. Consider refactoring to remove legacy dependencies
4. Implement the highest priority items from the roadmap
5. Review and update environment variables
