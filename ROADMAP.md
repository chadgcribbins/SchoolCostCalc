│   ├── CostComparisonChart
│   ├── TimelineChart
│   └── BreakdownChart
├── CostSummary
│   ├── SchoolComparison
│   ├── TotalCostDisplay
│   └── TaxBenefitCalculator
└── ScenarioPlanner
    ├── EarlyWithdrawalCalculator
    ├── SchoolTransferSimulator
    ├── AdditionalChildPlanner
    └── PublicPrivateComparison
