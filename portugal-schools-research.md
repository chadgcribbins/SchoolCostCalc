## Overall 10-Year Cost Comparison

Total estimated costs over 10 years for our family at each school (assuming all children complete school, including typical optional expenses):

- **The Lisboan**: Higher early-year tuition than St. Dominic's but no sibling discounts
- **TASIS Portugal**: Includes lunches, snacks, books, and activities; third child gets 15% off for about half the period
- **St. Dominic's**: Lower tuition in primary plus sibling discounts (5% & 15%) make it cost-effective in earlier years, but annual registration fees and steep high school tuition contribute significantly later
