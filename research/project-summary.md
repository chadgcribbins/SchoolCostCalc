# SchoolCostCalc: Private School Cost Calculator (Portugal)

## Project Overview

SchoolCostCalc is a financial planning resource designed to help families project and compare the costs of private international education in Portugal over a 10-year period. The project currently provides comprehensive cost modeling for three prominent international schools in the Lisbon area: The Lisboan International School, TASIS Portugal, and Saint Dominic's International School.

## Current State (v1.0.0)

The project exists as a well-structured research document with comprehensive data on school fees, costs, and projections. We have completed the data collection and analysis phase with detailed information on each school's fee structure, optional costs, and sibling discount policies.

### Completed Components

1. **Comprehensive Research Documentation**

   - Detailed breakdown of all three schools' fee structures
   - Accurate one-time and recurring fees for each institution
   - Complete analysis of sibling discount policies
   - Year-by-year cost projections with 3% inflation modeling
   - Optional vs. mandatory cost categorization

2. **Cost Projection Models**

   - 10-year financial projections for all schools (2025-2035)
   - Itemized breakdown of tuition, fees, and additional costs
   - Calculations that account for grade progression and fee changes

3. **Comparative Analysis Framework**
   - Side-by-side comparison methodology established
   - Currency conversion support (EUR to GBP)
   - Total cost analysis across different scenarios

## Current Implementation

The project's current implementation consists of:

- **Individual School Cost Models**: Each school has its own detailed cost structure and projection model that accounts for:

  - One-time enrollment fees
  - Annual tuition fees (with grade-based adjustments)
  - Mandatory recurring fees
  - Optional costs (lunch, transport, uniforms, etc.)
  - Applicable sibling discounts

- **Cost Projection Framework**: The system models costs over a 10-year period (2025-2035) with:

  - Year-by-year breakdown
  - Accounting for children's grade progression
  - Inflation adjustments (3% annual)
  - Family total calculations (all children combined)

- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparison of schools across:
  - Total 10-year costs
  - Year-by-year cost comparison
  - Mandatory vs. optional cost breakdowns
  - Cost impacts of different payment schedules

## Key Findings

Our research yielded several important insights:

1. **Significant Cost Variation**: Total 10-year costs vary substantially between schools:

   - The Lisboan: Approximately €360,000 plus one-time fees
   - TASIS Portugal: Approximately €430,000 plus one-time fees
   - Saint Dominic's: Approximately €525,000 plus one-time fees

2. **Sibling Discount Impact**: Schools with sibling discounts (TASIS and Saint Dominic's) can provide substantial savings for multi-child families.

3. **Hidden Costs Matter**: While TASIS has higher baseline tuition, its all-inclusive approach (covering lunch, activities, etc.) may offset apparent price differences.

4. **Fee Structure Differences**: Schools differ significantly in how fees are structured:
   - One-time vs. recurring fees
   - Included vs. separate optional costs
   - Grade-based tuition increases
