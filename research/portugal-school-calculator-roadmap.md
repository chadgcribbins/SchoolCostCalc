# Portugal School Cost Calculator - Enhancement Plan

## Project Summary

We've built an interactive calculator tool that helps parents compare the 10-year costs of sending children to three private international schools in Portugal (The Lisboan, TASIS Portugal, and St. Dominic's) from 2025-2035.

### Key Inputs
- **Family Configuration**: Names, ages, and expected graduation years for children
- **Optional Costs**: Toggles for lunch, transport, uniforms, activities, trips, and exam fees
- **Currency Settings**: EUR/GBP with adjustable exchange rate

### Core Features
- Comparison of one-time fees, mandatory costs, and optional costs across schools
- Visualization of total costs through charts
- Breakdown of key differences between schools (sibling discounts, included services)
- Adjustment of costs based on children's enrollment periods

## Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Cost Customization & Inflation Model
*Target: Allow users to fine-tune all financial inputs for more accurate projections*

1. **Base Tuition Adjustment**
   - Add input fields for each grade level's tuition at each school
   - Implement validation to prevent unrealistic values

2. **Fee Customization**
   - Create controls for modifying application/registration fees
   - Add inputs for annual recurring fees

3. **Inflation Modeling**
   - Implement inflation rate slider (0-10%)
   - Add toggle to enable/disable inflation calculations
   - Create visual indicator showing inflation impact over time

4. **Cost Presets**
   - Save/load functionality for different cost scenarios
   - Default preset with official published rates

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Visualization
*Target: Provide deeper insights through more sophisticated visualizations*

1. **Cost Breakdown Charts**
   - Stacked bar chart showing mandatory vs. optional vs. one-time fees
   - Pie charts displaying proportion of different cost categories
   - School-by-school breakdown of where money goes

2. **Time-Based Visualizations**
   - Cumulative cost graph showing spending over the 10-year period
   - Annual cost comparison with highlighted milestone years
   - Cash flow projection showing payment timing

3. **Child-Specific Views**
   - Per-child cost breakdown
   - Visual timeline of each child's education journey
   - Indication of grade transitions and key educational milestones

4. **Interactive Chart Features**
   - Tooltips with detailed information on hover
   - Ability to toggle data series on/off
   - Options to change chart types based on user preference

### Phase 3: Payment & Financial Planning Tools
*Target: Help parents plan how to manage education expenses*

1. **Payment Plan Simulator**
   - Monthly vs. term vs. annual payment comparison
   - Interest calculation for payment plans
   - Future payment schedule generator

2. **Education Savings Calculator**
   - Required monthly savings calculator
   - Investment growth projections
   - Tax implications of different education savings vehicles (if applicable)

3. **Budget Impact Analysis**
   - Percentage of household income required
   - Comparison to other major expenses
   - "Affordability calculator" based on income inputs

4. **Financial Scenario Testing**
   - "What if" analysis for different financial situations
   - Exchange rate sensitivity analysis for expat families
   - Impact of adding/removing children from private education

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimizations
*Target: Add specialized features and improve overall experience*

1. **Data Import/Export**
   - Export calculations to PDF/Excel
   - Save configurations for future reference
   - Import custom fee structures

2. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Responsive design improvements
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Simplified views for small screens

3. **ROI & Comparison Tools**
   - Public vs. private education cost comparison
   - Long-term ROI calculator for international education
   - University preparation metrics

4. **UX Enhancements**
   - Animations for transitions between views
   - Contextual help throughout the interface
   - User onboarding tutorial

## Implementation Notes

- Each phase should be implemented sequentially, with testing between phases
- Focus on maintaining performance even as features are added
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data/inputs
- Keep the interface intuitive despite increasing complexity
- Document all assumptions made in calculations
- Incorporate user feedback between phases

## Technologies

- React for UI components
- Recharts for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- LocalStorage for saving user preferences
