# Portugal School Cost Calculator - Enhancement Plan

## Project Summary

We've built a foundation for an interactive calculator tool that helps parents compare the 10-year costs of sending children to three private international schools in Portugal (The Lisboan, TASIS Portugal, and St. Dominic's) from 2025-2035.

### Projected Functionality
- **Family Configuration**: Names, ages, and expected graduation years for children
- **Optional Costs**: Toggles for lunch, transport, uniforms, activities, trips, and exam fees
- **Currency Settings**: EUR/GBP with adjustable exchange rate

### Core Features (To Be Implemented)
- Comparison of one-time fees, mandatory costs, and optional costs across schools
- Visualization of total costs through charts
- Breakdown of key differences between schools (sibling discounts, included services)
- Adjustment of costs based on children's enrollment periods

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Application Architecture

The application will be built as a React application with the following component structure:

1. **MainCalculator**: The core component that handles state management and calculations
   - Maintains the primary state for the calculator
   - Coordinates data flow between child components
   - Handles the primary calculation logic

2. **CostCustomizationPanel**: For customizing school costs and inflation settings
   - Controls for adjusting tuition rates
   - Inflation rate configuration
   - Fee structure customization

3. **FamilyMembersPanel**: For adding and managing family members
   - Add/edit/remove children
   - Set ages and grade levels
   - Configure enrollment periods

4. **YearlyProjection**: Detailed year-by-year cost projection
   - Tabular view of costs by year
   - Breakdown by child and school
   - Toggle between payment periods (annual/term/monthly)

5. **VisualizationPanel**: Interactive charts and visualizations
   - Multiple chart types for different analyses
   - Interactive elements for exploring data
   - Configurable views and filters

6. **CostSummary**: Summary of total costs across all schools
   - High-level comparison of total costs
   - Side-by-side school comparison
   - One-time vs. recurring cost breakdown

### Technical Requirements

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI/Radix UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: React-chartjs-2 for interactive charts
- **State Management**: React Context API or similar lightweight solution
- **Build/Deploy**: Next.js App Router framework

### Development Environment

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn for package management
- Local development server with hot reloading

   - Default preset with official published rates

### Phase 3: Enhanced Data Visualization
*Target: Provide deeper insights through more sophisticated visualizations*

1. **Cost Breakdown Charts**
   - Stacked bar chart showing mandatory vs. optional vs. one-time fees
   - Pie charts displaying proportion of different cost categories
   - School-by-school breakdown of where money goes

2. **Time-Based Visualizations**
   - Cumulative cost graph showing spending over the 10-year period
   - Annual cost comparison with highlighted milestone years
   - Cash flow projection showing payment timing

3. **Child-Specific Views**
   - Per-child cost breakdown
   - Visual timeline of each child's education journey
   - Indication of grade transitions and key educational milestones

4. **Interactive Chart Features**
   - Tooltips with detailed information on hover
   - Ability to toggle data series on/off
   - Options to change chart types based on user preference

### Phase 4: Payment & Financial Planning Tools
*Target: Help parents plan how to manage education expenses*

1. **Payment Plan Simulator**
   - Monthly vs. term vs. annual payment comparison
   - Interest calculation for payment plans
   - Future payment schedule generator

2. **Education Savings Calculator**
   - Required monthly savings calculator
   - Investment growth projections
   - Tax implications of different education savings vehicles (if applicable)

3. **Budget Impact Analysis**
   - Percentage of household income required
   - Comparison to other major expenses
   - "Affordability calculator" based on income inputs

4. **Financial Scenario Testing**
   - "What if" analysis for different financial situations
   - Exchange rate sensitivity analysis for expat families
   - Impact of adding/removing children from private education

### Phase 5: Advanced Features & Optimizations
*Target: Add specialized features and improve overall experience*

## Component Interactions

The application components will interact as follows:

```
MainCalculator
├── FamilyMembersPanel
│   └── FamilyMember (multiple instances)
├── CostCustomizationPanel
│   ├── SchoolSelector
│   ├── TuitionEditor
│   └── InflationControl
├── YearlyProjection
│   └── YearCostRow (multiple instances)
├── VisualizationPanel
│   ├── CostComparisonChart
│   ├── TimelineChart
│   └── BreakdownChart
└── CostSummary
    ├── SchoolComparison
    └── TotalCostDisplay
```

## Implementation Notes

- Each phase should be implemented sequentially, with testing between phases
- Focus on maintaining performance even as features are added
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing data/inputs
- Keep the interface intuitive despite increasing complexity
- Document all assumptions made in calculations
- Incorporate user feedback between phases

## Customization

The calculator will come pre-loaded with the thoroughly researched data for three international schools. Users will be able to customize this data by:

1. Modifying the default school data through the UI
2. Adjusting the inflation rate and cost parameters
3. Adding new schools or cost categories
4. Saving and loading different scenarios

## Usage Guide (Future)

1. Add family members and set their ages/grades
2. Customize school costs if needed
3. Enable/disable optional costs
4. View the cost summary and yearly projections
5. Explore different visualizations to understand the cost breakdown
6. Export or save calculations for future reference
