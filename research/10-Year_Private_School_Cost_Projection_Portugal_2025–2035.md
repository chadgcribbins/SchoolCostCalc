# 10-Year Private School Cost Projection (Portugal: 2025–2035)

_This document provides a detailed overview of expected educational expenses for a family with three children attending private international schools in Portugal over the next decade._

## Overview and Assumptions

This analysis details all costs for three children (currently ages 13, 10, and 8) attending private schools in Portugal over the next 10 years, until the youngest finishes secondary school around 18 years old. We cover three schools – The Lisboan International School, TASIS Portugal, and Saint Dominic's International School – using each school's published tuition and fees.

### Key Methodology

- All costs are presented in EUR with GBP conversion (€1 = £0.835, April 2025)
- We distinguish between one-time mandatory fees, recurring mandatory costs, and optional costs
- Sibling discounts are applied where applicable according to each school's policy
- The analysis follows each child through different grade levels as they progress

### Base Assumptions

- **Children's Ages/Grades**: 
  - Child 1: Age 13 (beginning in Grade/Year 8)
  - Child 2: Age 10 (beginning in Grade/Year 5)
  - Child 3: Age 8 (beginning in Grade/Year 3)

- **Progression Timeline**:
  - Child 1: Completes Grade 12 in Year 5 of projection (graduates)
  - Child 2: Completes Grade 12 in Year 8 of projection (graduates)
  - Child 3: Completes Grade 12 in Year 10 of projection (graduates)

- **Cost Inflation**: Annual inflation rate for school fees is estimated at 3%

- **Optional Costs**: Standard estimates used for lunch (€1,000/year), transport (€3,000/year), uniforms (€300/year), activities (€500/year), and school trips (€500/year) unless otherwise specified

## The Lisboan International School

### One-Time Fees

- Child 1 (Year 8): €17,950
- Child 2 (Year 5): €15,950
- Child 3 (Year 3): €15,950
- Family Total: €49,850

### Recurring Annual Fees
The Lisboan does not charge an annual re-enrollment or capital fee each year – the €4,750 registration is one-time only. No published sibling discount policy exists.

## Key Findings

1. **Total Cost Comparison**: While TASIS has higher annual tuition, its all-inclusive approach (lunch included) results in a slightly lower 10-year total than The Lisboan.

2. **Sibling Discount Impact**: Saint Dominic's offers more substantial sibling discounts, but higher base tuition and annual registration fees offset these savings.

3. **Payment Structure Differences**: The schools differ significantly in how fees are structured, with Saint Dominic's having higher recurring non-tuition fees.

4. **Grade Progression Impact**: Costs increase significantly as children move to higher grades, particularly in the transition to high school/IB years.

5. **Graduation Effect**: Overall family costs decrease substantially as each child graduates, with the most dramatic drop after the first child completes school.
