# 10-Year Private School Cost Projection (Portugal: 2025–2035)

_This document provides a detailed overview of expected educational expenses for a family with three children attending private international schools in Portugal over the next decade._

## Overview and Assumptions

This analysis details all costs for three children (currently ages 13, 10, and 8) attending private schools in Portugal over the next 10 years, until the youngest finishes secondary school around 18 years old. We cover three schools – The Lisboan International School, TASIS Portugal, and Saint Dominic's International School – using each school's published tuition and fees.

### Key Methodology

- All costs are presented in EUR with GBP conversion (€1 = £0.835, April 2025)
- We distinguish between one-time mandatory fees, recurring mandatory costs, and optional costs
- Sibling discounts are applied where applicable according to each school's policy
- The analysis follows each child through different grade levels as they progress

### Base Assumptions

- **Children's Ages/Grades**: 
  - Child 1: Age 13 (beginning in Grade/Year 8)
  - Child 2: Age 10 (beginning in Grade/Year 5)
  - Child 3: Age 8 (beginning in Grade/Year 3)

- **Progression Timeline**:
  - Child 1: Completes Grade 12 in Year 5 of projection (graduates)
  - Child 2: Completes Grade 12 in Year 8 of projection (graduates)
  - Child 3: Completes Grade 12 in Year 10 of projection (graduates)

- **Cost Inflation**: Annual inflation rate for school fees is estimated at 3%

- **Optional Costs**: Standard estimates used for lunch (€1,000/year), transport (€3,000/year), uniforms (€300/year), activities (€500/year), and school trips (€500/year) unless otherwise specified

## The Lisboan International School

### School Profile
A new British-curriculum international school in Lisbon (opened 2023), offering Nursery through Year 13 (ages 3–18). It follows the UK Key Stages and IB Diploma in the final years.

### One-Time Fees
- **Application Fee**: €250 per child (non-refundable)
- **Registration Fee**: €4,750 per child (one-time, upon enrollment)

For our family: €250 ×3 = €750 in application fees, and €4,750 ×3 = €14,250 in registration fees.

### Annual Tuition Fees
The Lisboan's tuition is structured by year group:
- **Early Years** (Nursery/Reception): €11,950 per year 
- **Primary** (e.g. Year 3): €15,950 per year
- **Middle School** (e.g. Year 8): €17,950 per year
- **High School** (Year 12–13): €21,950 per year

For our family in the first projection year (2025-2026):
- Child 1 (Year 8): €17,950
- Child 2 (Year 5): €15,950
- Child 3 (Year 3): €15,950
- Family Total: €49,850

### Recurring Annual Fees
The Lisboan does not charge an annual re-enrollment or capital fee each year – the €4,750 registration is one-time only. No published sibling discount policy exists.

### Optional & Miscellaneous Costs
- **Lunch Program**: €1,000 per child per year
- **Uniforms**: €300 per child per year
- **Transport**: €3,000 per child per year
- **Extracurricular Activities**: €500 per child per year
- **School Trips**: €500 per child per year

### Payment Plan Options
The Lisboan offers annual payment or termly payments (3 terms per year) with no price difference. They do not advertise a monthly payment plan.

## TASIS Portugal

### School Profile
An American-style international school offering Pre-K through High School with an American curriculum and IB Diploma options.

### One-Time Fees
- **Application Fee**: €100 per child
- **Enrollment Fee**: €5,000 per child (one-time)
- **Annual Re-enrollment Fee**: €750 per student, each year

### Annual Tuition Fees
- **Grades 1–2**: €16,470 per year
- **Grades 3–5**: €18,330 per year
- **Grades 6–8**: €19,080 per year
- **Grades 9–10**: €21,990 per year
- **Grades 11–12**: €23,160 per year

For our family in the first projection year (2025-2026):
- Child 1 (Grade 8): €19,080
- Child 2 (Grade 5): €18,330
- Child 3 (Grade 3): €18,330 - 15% discount = €15,580
- Family Total: €52,990 (plus re-enrollment fees: €2,250)

TASIS tuition is notably comprehensive, including textbooks, instructional materials, lunch, snacks, standard field trips, and basic after-school activities.

## Key Findings

1. **Total Cost Comparison**: While TASIS has higher annual tuition, its all-inclusive approach (lunch included) results in a slightly lower 10-year total than The Lisboan.

2. **Sibling Discount Impact**: Saint Dominic's offers more substantial sibling discounts, but higher base tuition and annual registration fees offset these savings.

3. **Payment Structure Differences**: The schools differ significantly in how fees are structured, with Saint Dominic's having higher recurring non-tuition fees.

4. **Grade Progression Impact**: Costs increase significantly as children move to higher grades, particularly in the transition to high school/IB years.

5. **Graduation Effect**: Overall family costs decrease substantially as each child graduates, with the most dramatic drop after the first child completes school.

## Risk Factors and Alternative Scenarios

### Risk Factors

1. **Fee Increases Above Inflation**: While we've assumed a 3% annual inflation rate, schools may increase fees by higher amounts, particularly in response to economic conditions or facilities expansion. Historical data from international schools shows that fee increases have occasionally exceeded inflation by 2-4% in certain years.

2. **Currency Exchange Risk**: For expatriate families with income in GBP, USD, or other currencies, fluctuations in the EUR exchange rate could significantly impact the real cost of education. A 10% weakening of a family's home currency against the EUR would effectively add 10% to all costs.

3. **Policy Changes**: Schools may alter their fee structures, sibling discount policies, or included services. For example, if TASIS were to start charging separately for lunch (currently included), this would add approximately €3,000 per year to a three-child family's cost.

4. **Additional Mandatory Fees**: Schools sometimes introduce new fees (technology fees, building funds, etc.). For example, a new €500/year technology fee would add €15,000 to the 10-year projection for a three-child family.

5. **Hidden Cost Inflation**: While tuition often increases at published rates, optional costs like transport, uniforms, and activities may increase at higher rates, potentially adding 5-10% to projected optional costs over time.

### Alternative Scenarios

1. **Early Withdrawal**: If a child leaves the school system early (e.g., to attend a boarding school abroad), this impacts both the direct costs and sibling discounts:

   **Example**: If Child 1 leaves after Year 3 for a UK boarding school:
   - Direct savings on remaining two years of tuition/fees: ~€50,000
   - Loss of sibling discount for Child 3 at TASIS: Additional ~€5,500 over two years
   - Net effect: ~€44,500 reduction in projected costs

2. **School Transfer**: Moving a child between schools can have complex cost implications:

   **Example**: Moving all three children from TASIS to The Lisboan after Year 2:
   - New registration fees: €14,250
   - Loss of sibling discount benefit at TASIS: ~€2,750/year
   - Potential savings on optional costs: ~€3,000/year (primarily lunch)
   - Net effect: Approximately €8,250 additional cost in Year 3, potentially breaking even by Year 5

3. **Additional Child**: Adding a fourth child to the family would trigger larger sibling discounts at both TASIS (25% for fourth child) and Saint Dominic's (25% for fourth child):

   **Example**: Fourth child entering in Year 3 (2027-2028) in early primary:
   - TASIS: 25% discount saves ~€4,500/year on tuition
   - Saint Dominic's: 25% discount saves ~€3,700/year on tuition
   - The Lisboan: No additional discount
   - Net effect: TASIS becomes more cost-effective for larger families

4. **Public School Alternative**: Comparing to the Portuguese public school system:

   - Public education in Portugal is free (except for books, supplies, and meals)
   - Approximate costs for three children in public school: €3,000-€5,000/year total
   - 10-year savings vs. private education: ~€450,000-€500,000
   - Considerations: Language immersion, curriculum differences, potential need for private tutoring

### Scholarship and Financial Aid Options

1. **Merit Scholarships**: Some international schools offer limited merit-based scholarships:
   - Saint Dominic's: Academic Excellence scholarships covering 10-25% of tuition for exceptional students
   - TASIS: Talent scholarships for arts and sports up to 15% of tuition
   - The Lisboan: New school establishing scholarship program, currently limited

2. **Corporate Education Allowances**: Many multinational employers provide education allowances for expatriate employees:
   - Typical corporate allowance: €10,000-€20,000 per child per year
   - May be capped at a total family amount
   - Usually requires documentation and direct billing arrangements

3. **Income-Based Financial Aid**: Limited availability at non-profit schools:
   - Saint Dominic's offers need-based aid to a small percentage of students
   - Documentation requirements include tax returns and financial statements
   - Typically reduces costs by 10-30% for qualifying families

## Tax Implications

### Portugal Resident Taxpayers

1. **Education Tax Deductions**: Portugal allows limited deduction of education expenses:
   - 30% of education expenses can be deducted up to a maximum of €800 per taxpayer
   - Applies to expenses for dependents registered in the household
   - Impact: Potential tax savings of up to €240 per year per taxpayer

2. **Dependent Child Credit**: Additional tax credits available per dependent child:
   - Fixed amount plus percentage based on age of child
   - Not directly related to education expenses but helps offset overall costs

### Non-Resident Considerations

1. **Foreign Tax Credits**: Families paying taxes in home countries may have different considerations:
   - UK: No specific tax relief for private education
   - US: 529 education savings plans may provide tax advantages but typically only for higher education
   - Tax treaties may impact how education allowances are taxed

2. **Corporate Structures**: Some expatriate packages structure education benefits through employer-paid arrangements that may have more favorable tax treatment than direct payment by parents.

## Grade Progression Table

The following table shows the exact grade/year placement of each child throughout the 10-year projection period:

| 5    | 2029-2030   | Grade/Year 12       | Grade/Year 9        | Grade/Year 7        |
| 6    | 2030-2031   | Graduated           | Grade/Year 10       | Grade/Year 8        |
| 7    | 2031-2032   | Graduated           | Grade/Year 11       | Grade/Year 9        |
| 8    | 2032-2033   | Graduated           | Grade/Year 12       | Grade/Year 10       |
| 9    | 2033-2034   | Graduated           | Graduated           | Grade/Year 11       |
| 10   | 2034-2035   | Graduated           | Graduated           | Grade/Year 12       |

This progression table helps visualize exactly when each child moves through different fee brackets and when sibling discount structures would change as children graduate.
