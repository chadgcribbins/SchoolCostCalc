# Review and Gap Analysis: 10-Year Private School Cost Projection

## Document Structure Issues

1. **Duplicated Content**: The document appears to have duplicate content and text fragments - the same sections are repeated in different parts of the document (especially in the later sections about the web application).

2. **Incomplete Sentences**: Several sections end abruptly mid-sentence, particularly at the end of the document where it cuts off with "(or".

3. **Formatting Inconsistencies**: There are some inconsistencies in heading levels and formatting throughout the document.

4. **Merged Content**: The document appears to combine both the original research document and web application descriptions without clear separation.

## Content Gaps and Inconsistencies

1. **Inflation Rate Discrepancy**: In the overview section, the document states "we use 2025/26 fee rates and assume they remain constant (no inflation)" but other sections mention a 3% inflation rate being applied.

2. **Exit Scenarios**: While the document mentions children graduating at different times, it doesn't fully address how costs change when children leave the school system (only briefly discussed for sibling discounts).

3. **Specific Grade Placement**: Although age ranges are provided, there could be more clarity about exactly which grades each child would be in each year, perhaps in a simple table format.

4. **Cumulative Total Calculation**: The document provides annual costs but lacks a clear explanation of how the total 10-year costs (€360,000 for Lisboan, €430,000 for TASIS, €525,000 for Saint Dominic's) were calculated.

5. **Tuition Increase Trajectory**: While a 3% inflation rate is mentioned, there's no detailed analysis of how tuition has historically increased at these specific schools (if data is available).

6. **Web App Description Confusion**: The second half of the document shifts to describing a web application that doesn't yet exist, but presents it as if it's already functional.

## Missing Elements

1. **Specific Risk Factors**: No discussion of potential risks like unexpected fee increases, currency fluctuations for expat families, or policy changes at schools.

2. **Alternative Scenarios**: Limited exploration of what happens if a child leaves early, transfers between schools, or if the family adds another child.

3. **Scholarship or Financial Aid**: No mention of potential scholarship opportunities or financial aid programs that might offset costs.

4. **Tax Implications**: No discussion of potential tax benefits or implications related to private education expenses in Portugal.

5. **Comparison to Public Education**: No comparative baseline with Portuguese public school costs (or lack thereof) to illustrate the premium being paid.

6. **Implementation Timeline**: For the web application portion, no clear development timeline or milestones are provided.

## Recommendations

1. **Clean Up Document Structure**: Remove duplicated content and ensure sections flow logically from one to another.

2. **Complete Unfinished Sections**: Finish incomplete sentences and sections, particularly at the end of the document.

3. **Add Missing Elements**: Add sections addressing the gaps identified above, particularly around risk factors, alternative scenarios, and detailed grade progression.

4. **Separate Research from Implementation Plan**: Clearly distinguish between the current research findings and the future web application plans.

5. **Standardize Assumptions**: Ensure consistency in assumptions about inflation rates throughout the document.

6. **Enhance Visualization Plans**: Add more specific details about how data will be visualized in the planned application, perhaps with mockups or wireframes.

7. **Include Exact Grade Progression**: Add a table showing each child's exact grade placement for each of the 10 years to make calculations more transparent.
